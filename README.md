## üåé Overview

Pollverse is a metaverse DAO facilitating better public policy. 

Governments and civic organizations can introduce DAO-like proposals for community matters where citizens and legal residents can vote and post opinions. 

Pollverse also allows constituents to experience and provide feedback to urban planning designs through VR and AR, and helps organizations analyze patterns in human behavior.

**Creating the CivicTechDAO‚Ä¶**

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è User Onboarding

In the US, legal residents without citizenship can't participate in voting. Governments and civic organizations in jurisdictions with large  legal immigrant populations suffer from more civic disengagement. 

Pollverse verifies users' legal residency and citizenship upon signup. Citizens will still have full access to the political system. However, governments can introduce  DAO-like proposals for community matters where citizens and legal residents can vote and post opinions. 

### üó≥Ô∏è Voting on Community Matters

By opening certain aspects of government decision-making to the community, governments can quickly access top industry talent for faster and more informed decisions. For instance, implementing DAO-like proposals for procurement selection could prevent contractor overcharging and scams, such as the case of the Canadian government paying $54 million for a consultancy to build the ArriveCAN application, a simple mobile and web application to upload COVID-19 related travel documentation. In a DAO proposal process, verified software developers in Canada could raise concerns about the app building being overpriced. Underfunded governments and civic organizations can unlock the community to help them make better decisions. 

Residents can sign up for notifications from Pollverse using their email, phone number, or Telegram. In the long run, to prevent spam, Pollverse could implement a voting system for residents to determine which organizations can access their contact information for sending notifications. Additionally, residents could choose the types of notifications they would like to receive.

### üì• Notifications

Governments and civic organizations face a significant challenge in effectively communicating with residents on community matters in a cost-effective manner. While they often invest resources and are legally obligated to notify residents about certain civic events such as elections or disruptions to water supply, they lack affordable digital channels to reach residents and notify them about critical feedback surveys on government performance. This lack of accessible channels can result in lower participation rates, preventing valuable insights into the needs and concerns of residents from being captured.


### üéß VR Experiences

Closed, non-interactive design plans for urban development hinder community alignment and participation. For example,  the construction of highways through American urban cores in the 1950s and 1960s had negative social and environmental impacts. Imagine if  constituents could experience proposed designs and identify potential impacts before construction. The layout of the modern American city would be more prosperous, equitable, and environmentally safe.

Pollverse's VR and AR experiences let constituents experience proposed designs and their potential impact on cities before construction, providing a more informed decision-making process. This game-like approach attracts younger constituents to become more engaged.

In addition, organizations can offer bounties for solution updates to existing design plans, enabling the government to collaborate with community architects. Governments can also sell pre-developed design assets to other governments, architecture firms, and gaming studios as NFTs, resulting in additional revenue streams.
