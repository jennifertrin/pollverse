## üåé Overview

Pollverse is a metaverse DAO facilitating better public policy. 

Governments and civic organizations can introduce DAO-like proposals for community matters where citizens and legal residents can vote and post opinions. 

Pollverse also allows constituents to experience and provide feedback to urban planning designs through VR and AR, and helps organizations analyze patterns in human behavior.

**Creating the CivicTechDAO‚Ä¶**

### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è User Onboarding

In the US, legal residents without citizenship can't participate in voting which leads to a lack of engagement and comprehensive feedback for governments and civic organizations. Pollverse verifies users' legal residency and citizenship upon signup. Governments can introduce  DAO-like proposals for community matters where citizens and legal residents can vote and post opinions.  Governments can set voting power ratios to give citizens more voting power. Only citizens can still vote for political offices.

By opening certain aspects of government decision-making to the community, governments can quickly access top industry talent for faster and more informed decisions. For instance, implementing DAO-like proposals for procurement selection could prevent contractor overcharging and scams, such as the case of the Canadian government paying $54 million for a consultancy to build the ArriveCAN application, a simple mobile and web application to upload COVID-19 related travel documentation. In a DAO proposal process, verified software developers in Canada could raise concerns about the app building being overpriced. Underfunded governments and civic organizations can unlock the community to help them make better decisions. 

### üéß VR Experiences

Closed, non-interactive design plans for urban development hinder community alignment and participation. For example,  the construction of highways through American urban cores in the 1950s and 1960s had negative social and environmental impacts. Imagine if  constituents could experience proposed designs and identify potential impacts before construction. The layout of the modern American city would be more prosperous, equitable, and environmentally safe.

Pollverse's VR and AR experiences let constituents experience proposed designs and their potential impact on cities before construction, providing a more informed decision-making process. This game-like approach attracts younger constituents to become more engaged.

In addition, organizations can offer bounties for solution updates to existing design plans, enabling the government to collaborate with community architects. Governments can also sell pre-developed design assets to other governments, architecture firms, and gaming studios as NFTs, resulting in additional revenue streams.
